You Raise Me Up
When I am down and oh my soul so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then I am still and wait here in the silenceUntil you come and sit awhile with me

You raise me up 
so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

I am strong when I am on your shoulders

You raise me up
To more than I can be
